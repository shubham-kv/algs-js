- [ ] Make DFS Graph visualization step-able to allow play, pause, go to
  previous step, go to next step, etc. (Currently it does all the processing in
  one go).

- [x] Add Linked Stack data structure
- [x] Make changes to DFS Graph to use iterative version of stack

## `Sun, 31 Aug 2025 10:56:22 +0530`

- [ ] Draw growing edges for Depth First Search Graph visualization  
    `Status`: `TRIED`, `ON_HOLD`  
    `Comments`: Took very long trying to get it working
- [x] Add Linked Queue data structure
- [ ] Add ability to randomly generate graph for DFS Graph visualization  
    `Status`: `TRIED`, `ON_HOLD`  
    `Comments`: Made progress, but the vertices & edges were sticking close to one
    another and I had to adjust the graph to make it look cleaner
- [ ] Add Breadth First Search visualization
